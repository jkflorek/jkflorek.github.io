Hello, internet! I'm Jeff and this is the first post on my website!

What is this place? I'm not sure right now, I'm probably going to host some
projects of mine and maybe I'll actually write a blog (yeah, right).

This site is powered by Github Pages and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'd
also like to thank [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/) for [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) guide
on how to set up a personal website using Github and Jekyll.

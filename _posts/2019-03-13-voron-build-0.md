# Introduction
This post is the first in a series documenting my build of a [Voron 1.6](http://vorondesign.com/voron1.6) 3D printer. What is a Voron? While I could try my hand at explaining or I could just quote the designers themselves (from [the VORON Design website](http://vorondesign.com/)):
>The original goal of the VORON project, back in 2015, was to create a no-compromise 3D printer that was fun to assemble and a joy to use. It had to be quiet, clean, pretty, and continue to operate 24 hours a day without requiring constant fiddling. In short a true home micro-manufacturing machine without a hefty price tag. It took over a year in development, with every part being redesigned, stress tested and optimized. Shortly after the release a vibrant community formed around the project and continues to grow today. This community is part of what makes VORON such a special experience.

>What was once a one-person operation has grown into a small tight-knit group of engineers united under a common design ethos. We're dedicated to creating production-quality printers you can assemble in your kitchen. It's this passion and dedication that drive us to push the boundaries just a little further. We build space shuttles with gardening tools so anyone can have a space shuttle of their own.

I had nearly completed the building of a Voron 1.5 (way back in 2017), but since I had never finished it to a quality that I was happy with I've decided to repurpose the parts into a new and improved Voron 1.6.

As of today, I've received just about everything I need to begin the process. I'm currently just waiting on some flanged bearings to arrive from Amazon (should arrive within a week). Once everything has arrived and been accounted for, I'll begin the assembly process.

<p>Hello, internet! I'm Jeff and this is the first post on my website!</p>

<p>What is this place? I'm not sure right now, I'm probably going to host some
  projects of mine and maybe I'll actually write a blog (yeah, right).</p>

<p>This site is powered by Github Pages and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I'd
also like to thank <a href="http://jmcglone.com/">Jonathan McGlone</a> for
<a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this</a> guide and 
  <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">Start Bootstrap</a> for the theme.</p>

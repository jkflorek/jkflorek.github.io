First Post!
===========

Hello, internet! I'm Jeff and this is the first post on my website!

What is this place? I'm not sure right now, I'm probably going to host some
projects of mine and maybe I'll actually write a blog (yeah, right).

This post is mostly so I can play around with Markdown formatting and figure
out how it works.

Here's a list:

  * Spiders
  * Crabs
  * Grasshoppers

Here is an em dash --- wow look at that!

Code, too!

    print("Hello, World!")

Tables are neat.

----- | ----- | -----
1     | 3.01  | 0.02
2     | 2.56  | 0.03
3     | 1.00  | 0.01
4     | 2.05  | 0.05
5     | 40.0  | 0.1
